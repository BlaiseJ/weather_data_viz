Find distance between two longitude and latitude points
-------------------------------------------------------
- Search this on google (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-distance-two-points-earth/)

Distance, d = 3963.0 * arccos[(sin(lat1) * sin(lat2)) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(long2 â€“ long1)]

The obtained distance, d, is in miles. If you want your value to be in units of kilometers, multiple d by 1.609344.
d in kilometers = 1.609344 * d in miles
Thus you can have the shortest distance between two places on Earth using the great circle distance approach.

- After identifying the closest station, head to the website and download the data for that station
